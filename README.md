# GitHub Agile Extension

This extension adds functionality to estimate issues on GitHub.

## Setup

GitHub Agile Extension is a Chrome Extension. You need to install it from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

## How to use

In issues titles you can add *consumed points* **between parentheses** and *story points* **between brackets**. Example: `My title issue (2) [4]`.

The extension also manages a boundary display by putting two values separated by a dash as story points. Example: `My title issue (4) [4-6]`.

Theses points are automatically picked up by the extension and displayed in a better view.

## Where is it displayed?

### In the project page

For each column the total amount of cards points is calculed and shown in the column title. The amounts are refreshed after each cards title update.

You can also download a summary of all cards in CSV file by clicking on the ⬇ link on the left of the filter cards input.

### In the issues list page

For each issue, the points are just displayed in a better view.
